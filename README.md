### Tier 1 — 

### Front End ✔️

-Essential components have been incorporated and laid out on the page.

-User is able to navigate through the page using necessary routes.

-User interface is thoughtfully designed.  You may use vanilla CSS, or better yet, use a CSS Framework or styled Components.

-As a user, I want the app to have a nice UX, so that I can be happy and enjoy my time using the app. Think about how styling enhances the user     experience

-As a user, I want to see the data nicely organized, so that I can consume and interact with it. Make sure where data is located makes sense from a user perspective


### Back End ✔️

-As a user, I want to read entries from the database

-As a user, I want to add entries to the database

-As a user, I want to delete entries from the database

-As a user, I want to edit entries in the database

-As a user, I expect to do all of the above by accessing RESTful routes


### Deployment ✔️

-Deploy the application using the service of your choice.

-Tier 2 - Deployed Application via Continuous Deployment

-Set up continuous deployments so that the application is deployed upon push/merge to main (or some other trigger).

-Main Goal: The deployed app should be the most up to date version of your working-and-tested repository code.

-Create a GitHub Workflow file for GitHub Actions and/or other necessary files for your deployment.



### Tier 3 - Continuous Integration ✔️

-Create a Branch Protection Rule to run the tests upon Pull Requests to the main branch.

-Upon successful test runs, Github Actions should deploy your application.



### Tier 4 - Login/Register/Authentication ✔️

-As a user, I can create a new account with my information saved in a database.

-As a user, I can login to the account to retrieve information specific to my account. This information is displayed on the screen to make my user experience different from other users.

-As User B, I should not have access to User A’s private data (i.e. profile information, unpublished blog posts, private images…)

-Allow only authenticated users to access the private/profile/sharing portion of the application.

-Allow unauthenticated users to access other pages (like a welcome screen, or list of public posts)


### Tier 5 - Admin vs User & Further Security Implementations ✔️

-Create an admin setting that gives different controls to certain users of your application.

-Protect your app against OWASP Top 10.
